# Proposition Logic

[[Proposition]] is a statement that declares a fact that is either **true** or **false** but not both.

We use [[Proposition (or State) Variables]] to represent a proposition.

Area of logic that deals with proposition is called [[Proposition Logic]].

When we combine (using [[Logical Operators]]) multiple proposition to create a new proposition we have created a [[Compound Proposition]].

[[Negation]] of a proposition P, will be denoted by $\neg P$.

A [[Truth Table]] represents all the possible values for the proposition.

[[Logical Operators]] are used to create new propositions from existing propositions they are also known as **Connectives**.

A [[Conjunction]] $P \wedge Q$ (assuming P and Q as propositions) will be **True** if and only if both P and Q are **True**. 
A [[Disjunction]] $P \vee Q$ will be **True** if either of P or Q is **True**.

"Or" could be used in two context:
[[Inclusive OR]]: When at least one of the proposition is true.
[[Exclusive OR]]: When either of it could be true but not both.

[[Conditional Statement or Implication]] $P \rightarrow Q$ (pronounced as "if P then Q") asserts that Q is **True** only when P is **True**.
Here, P is called [[Premise]] and Q is called [[Conclusion]].
Implications could be understood as *pledges*. Like, a politician could say "If I get elected, then I will lower taxes."

Given a conditional statement $P \rightarrow Q$:
$Q \rightarrow P$ will be [[Converse]] of the statement
$\neg Q \rightarrow \neg P$ will be [[Contraposition]] of the statement
$\neg P \rightarrow \neg Q$ will be [[Inverse]] of the statement

Truth value of [[Contraposition]] is always same as the original statement.

When two [[Compound Proposition]] have same truth value they are called as [[Equivalent]]. [[Converse]] and [[Inverse]] of a statement are equivalent.

A [[Biconditional Statement]] $P \leftrightarrow Q$ implies that P is **True** if and only if Q is **True**. This statement will be true when both P and Q have same truth value.
It is [[Equivalent]] to $(P \rightarrow Q) \wedge (Q \rightarrow P)$.

## Precedence of logical operators
### $$\neg | \wedge | \vee | \rightarrow | \leftrightarrow $$

A [[Bit]] is a symbol with two possible values.
If a variable could only have **True (1)** or **False (0)** value then it is called [[Boolean Variable]].

A [[Bit String]] is a sequence of zero or more bits. Length of bit string is the number of bits in string.
Logical operations are performed on bit strings using [[Bitwise]] operators (bitwise AND, bitwise OR, bitwise XOR) represented by ($\wedge, \vee, \oplus$) respectively.
